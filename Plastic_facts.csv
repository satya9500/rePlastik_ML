PETE,Polyethylene terephthalate,1,Easily recyclable,"PETE is light weighted and makes a good gas and air barrier, and mostly used for making bottles. ",56 million tons per year,70 °C (160 °F),500°F (260°C),May release endocrine disruptors when degraded via chemical ways,"Lightweight, impact and shatter resistant.",69.14 (mj/kg),450 years
HDPE,High-Density Polyethylene,2,Easily recyclable,"HDPE has high strength and malleability; it is resistant to many solvents. Compared to PETE, it is more heat tolerant",30 million tons per year,120 °C ,266°F 130°C,Not biodegradable ,HDPE has a comparatively high density compared to other plastics,68.96 (mj/kg),100 years
PVC,Polyvinyl chloride,3,Moderately recyclable,"Rigid PVC has very high density making it very strong. It is long lasting and very economical, making it an easy choice for many industrial applications like construction.",40 millon tons per year,,,"Not biodegradable . When burned, it emits hydrogen chloride (HCl) fumes which is carcinogenic",,52.38 (mj/kg),Not degrable
LDPE,Low-Density Polyethylene,4,Moderately recyclable,"LDPE is very lightweighted, quite flexible and less strong compared to other plastics. It is widely used for manufacturing various containers, dispensing bottles, wash bottles, tubing, plastic parts for computer components, and plastic bags",25 million tons per year,,,"When exposed to ambient solar radiation the plastic produces two greenhouse gases, methane and ethylene",,74.08 (mj/kg),500-1000 years
PP,polypropylene,5,Moderately recyclable,"PP is resistant to fatigue, most plastic living hinges, such as those on flip-top bottles, are made from this material.Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kitchenwares.",55 million tons per year,,171 °C (340 °F),May contain chemicals toxic to the endocrine and reproductive system,,63.45 (mj/kg),Not degradable
PS,Polystyrene or Styrofoam,6,Difficult to recyclable,"PS can be solid or foamed. It is is clear, hard, and brittle. Products such as disposable coffee cups, plastic food boxes, plastic cutlery, packing foam, and packing peanuts are made from PS.",14 million tons per year,90 °C (194 °F),240 °C (464 °F),"PS is not biodegradable, very bio-resistant, and doesn't break down easily, if left in soil for 15 to 30 years has been shown to have little structural decay. ","It is a thermoplastic, it can be heated to melting point, cooled, and reheated again without significant degradation.",85.09 (mj/kg),50 years
Others,Miscellaneous Plastics,7,Very difficult to recycle,"Number 7 are plastics that are not defined by other codes, such as polycarbonate, polyctide, acrylic, acrylonitrile butadiene, styrene, fiberglass, and nylon. CDs, DVDs, baby bottles, large water bottles and medical storage containers fall under number 7. ",1 milion tons per year,,,Potential for chemical leaching into food or drink products packaged in polycarbonate containers made using BPA ,,93.31(mj/kg),Not degradable
